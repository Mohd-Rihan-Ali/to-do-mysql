# To-Do MySQL

This repository houses the To-Do MySQL application, a simple to-do list management system built with Express.js on the server side and React.js on the client side, utilizing MySQL for data storage.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using bcrypt for password hashing.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on to-do items.
- **Responsive Design**: The client-side application is designed to be responsive and work seamlessly across various devices.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Mohd-Rihan-Ali/to-do-mysql.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the server directory and install server dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd to-do-mysql/server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up MySQL Database**:
   - Install MySQL on your system if not already installed.
   - Log in to MySQL:
     ```bash
     mysql -u your_username -p
     ```
   - Create a new database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE todo_db;
     ```

4. **Create Database Schemas**:
   - In the MySQL console, switch to the newly created database:
     ```sql
     USE todo_db;
     ```
   - Create the necessary tables:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE users (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
     );

     CREATE TABLE todos (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       description TEXT,
       user_id INT NOT NULL,
       completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
       FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
     );
     ```

5. Navigate to the client directory and install client dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

6. Start the server:
   ```bash
   cd ../server
   node server.js
   ```

7. Start the client:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm start
   ```

8. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
